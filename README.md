Information for Running Code

<h3> What to Input </h3>
When starting up the program you are given a prompt to select a map. <br>
Please input a number of a existing map shown.

After that you a prompted to select an algorithm
Input 1 for BFS solution
Input 2 for Dijkstra solution

<h3> What is Returned </h3>
A map of the Shots Taken and where the ball ends up
Number of Shots Taken
Distance Travelled
For Dijkstra's there is a list of where the shots end up and if it rolls anywhere it is stated.
