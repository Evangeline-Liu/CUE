Information for Running Code

<h3> What to Input </h3>
When starting up the program you are given a prompt to select a map. <br>
Please input a number of a existing map shown.<br>
<br>
After that you a prompted to select an algorithm<br>
Input 1 for BFS solution<br>
Input 2 for Dijkstra solution<br>

<h3> What is Returned </h3>
A map of the Shots Taken and where the ball ends up<br>
Number of Shots Taken<br>
Distance Travelled<br>
For Dijkstra's there is a list of where the shots end up and if it rolls anywhere it is stated.<br>
Time to Execute Algorithm<br>
